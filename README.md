## Where I Am
I am currently in the infant stages of my journey of becoming a full stack web developer/programmer and would love for you to follow along my journey and career transition. Utilizing The Odin Project, Free Code Camp, and several Udemy courses my goal is become highly proficient with JavaScript, React JS, Python, and Azure! I am looking to connect and network with other awesome indviduals that may be starting thier developer/coding career or just looking to collab. I'm am always looking for motivation, constructive critism, and any tips or tricks to help me along my journey! I also love mentoring, coaching and brainstorming with people who want to do work they will be proud of.

## Who Am I
Originally from San Fernando, California. Relocated to Birmingham, Alabama in August of 2021(What a culture shock!).
I began my career in procurement previously as a Purchasing Mananger for The Marriott Hotels and most recently the IT infrastructure manager with Honda Manufacturing of Alabama. I developed a strong curiousity for coding/programming from my need for more powerful and automated spreadsheets to assist with my day to day task and inventory controls. My experience creating Excel spreadsheets using macros and vba lead me to JavaScript, which is where this journey begins.

### Current Progress:
 - [x] HTML5
 - [x] CSS3
 - [x] BootStrap
 - [ ] JavaScript
 - [ ] React Js
 - [ ] Python
 - [ ] Azure
